## About the game
![memory game](https://github.com/superd0ll/memory-game/blob/master/img/memory-game.png)
This memory game has been created with vanilla JavaScript with no support by any external JavaScript library such as for example jQuery.
The memory game has been created according to the instructions given by Udacity.
For instructions about playing the game please see below.

## How to play the game
The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

### Each turn:

The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
